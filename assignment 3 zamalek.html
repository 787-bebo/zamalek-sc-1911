<p>Zamalek SC,, commonly referred to as Zamalek, is an Egyptian sports club based in giza, known for its professional football team. The history of Zamalek SC originates in 1911, when the club was founded by George Merzbach on January 5 as Qasr El Nile (Arabic, translation: The Nile Palace Club). In 1913 the club moved its headquarters to the present-day intersection of 26 July Street and Ramses and became the Cairo International Sports Club, colloquially known as Nady El Qāhirah El Mokhtalat. The name changed again in 1942 to Nady Farouk El Awal at the request of King Farouk I. The current name of Zamalek was chosen in 1952 following the Egyptian revolution.</p>
